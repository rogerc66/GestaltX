A MobileGestalt editor for iPhone and iPad. Developed by [huamidev](https://github.com/huamidev).

Apple Internal Features sets `HasInternalSettingsBundle`, `InternalBuild`, and `apple-internal-install` to 1 when enabled, removes those keys when disabled, and preserves existing values with Keep Current. Enabling it may cause side effects, such as OTA updates not being detected properly or AI models failing to re-download.

Usually, changing the region code is enough to try enabling AI; there is no need to change Sales Region. Selecting United States for Region Code sets `RegionCode` to `LL` and keeps the sales-region suffix. You can also choose China (Mainland), Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan or the United Kingdom. Sales Region and Region Code can be applied together: the sales suffix follows Sales Region, while the code follows Region Code.

*If you previously changed Sales Region, restore your device’s original sales region and apply it first.*

Presets modify capability flags; actual effects depend on the device and OS. China-mainland devices can use the Apple Intelligence and region options to attempt activation; availability also depends on the model, OS version, and Apple services.

## Compatibility

Supports **iOS / iPadOS 27.x**. **iOS / iPadOS 26.x is not supported for on-device MobileGestalt access.** Powered by [worse_query](https://github.com/forcequitOS/worse_query). SystemGroup access requires iOS 27; available features depend on the device and OS. Local plist editing is also supported.

Signing requires a certificate and provisioning profile with at least one usable App Group. GestaltX detects the signed App Group at runtime.

## Language support

GestaltX follows your iOS language settings, with English as the default and fallback. Persian includes right-to-left layout support.
